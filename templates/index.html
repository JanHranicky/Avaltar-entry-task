  <h1>Welcome to Avaltar Entry Task Results</h1>
  <p>
    The goal of this task was to create a video streaming app in Python that continuously streams a given video and applies the YOLOv8 model to detect people.  
    As a result, two different approaches were implemented: streaming the video in HLS format and streaming the video as a series of JPEG images (Motion JPEG stream).  
    You can navigate to the dedicated pages using the buttons below. The MJPEG stream is available only by visiting the endpoint, while the HLS stream is generated by a dedicated script. Please refer to the GitHub repository for further instructions.
